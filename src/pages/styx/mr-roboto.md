<LyricSection>

どうもありがとうミスターロボット

またあうひまで

どうもありがとうミスターロボット

ひみつをしりたい

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

You are wondering who I am

(Secret, secret, I've got a secret)

Machine or mannequin

(Secret, secret, I've got a secret)

With parts made in Japan

(Secret, secret, I've got a secret)

I am the modern man

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

I've got a secret

I've been hiding under my skin

My heart is human, my blood is boiling

My brain IBM

So if you see me acting strangely, don't be surprised

I'm just a man who needed someone, and somewhere to hide

To keep me alive, just keep me alive

Somewhere to hide, to keep me alive

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

I'm not a robot without emotions

I'm not what you see

I've come to help you with your problems

So we can be free

I'm not a hero, I'm not the savior, forget what you know

I'm just a man whose circumstances went beyond his control

Beyond my control

We all need control

I need control

We all need control

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

I am the modern man

(Secret, secret, I've got a secret)

Who hides behind a mask

(Secret, secret, I've got a secret)

So no one else can see

(Secret, secret, I've got a secret)

My true identity

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

どうもありがとうミスターロボット

どうも、どうも...

どうもありがとうミスターロボット...

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

Thank you very much

ミスターロボット

For doing the jobs that nobody wants to

And thank you very much

ミスターロボット

For helping me escape just when I needed to

Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!

I want to thank you! Please, thank you!

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

The problem is plain to see

Too much technology

Machines to save our lives

Machines dehumanize

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

The time has come at last

(Secret, secret, I've got a secret)

To throw away this mask

(Secret, secret, I've got a secret)

Now everyone can see

(Secret, secret, I've got a secret)

My true identity!

I'm Kilroy! Kilroy! Kilroy! Kilroy!
