Sister Christian

Oh, the time has come

And you know that you&rsquo;re the only one

To say, okay

Where you going

What you looking for

You know those boys

Don&rsquo;t want to play no more with you

It&rsquo;s true

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

You&rsquo;re motoring

What&rsquo;s your price for flight

In finding mister right

You will be all right tonight

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

Babe, you know

You&rsquo;re growing up so fast

And mama&rsquo;s worrying

That you won&rsquo;t last

To say, let&rsquo;s play

Sister Christian

There&rsquo;s so much in life

Don&rsquo;t you give it up

Before your time is due

It&rsquo;s true

It&rsquo;s true

Yeah


</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

Motoring

What&rsquo;s your price for flight

You have got him in your sight

And driving through the night

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

Motoring

What&rsquo;s your price for flight

In finding mister right

You will be all right tonight

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

Sister Christian

Oh, the time has come

And you know that you&rsquo;re the only one

To say, okay

But you&rsquo;re motoring

(Yeah) Motoring
