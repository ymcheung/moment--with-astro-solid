<LyricSection>

On the street where you live, girls talk about their social lives

They are made of lipstick, plastic, and paint, a touch of sable in their eyes

All your life, all your life, all you have asked when is your daddy gonna talk to you

But you were living in another world trying to get your message through

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

No one heard a single word you said

They should have seen it in your eyes

What was going around your head

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

Woo, she is a little runaway

Daddy&rsquo;s girl learned fast

All those things he couldn&rsquo;t say

Woo, she is a little runaway

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

A different line every night guaranteed to blow your mind

I see you out on the streets, calling for a wild time

So you sit home alone, &rsquo;cause there&rsquo;s nothing left that you can do

There&rsquo;s only pictures hung in the shadows left there to look at you

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

You know she likes the lights at night on the neon Broadway signs

She don&rsquo;t really mind, it&rsquo;s only love she hoped to find

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

Woo, she is a little runaway

Daddy&rsquo;s girl learned fast

All those things he couldn&rsquo;t say

Woo, she is a little runaway

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

No one heard a single word you said

They should have seen it in your eyes

What was going around your head

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

Woo, she is a little runaway

Daddy&rsquo;s girl learned fast

All those things he couldn&rsquo;t say...
