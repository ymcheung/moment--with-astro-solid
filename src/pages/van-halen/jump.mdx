<LyricSection>

I get up and nothing gets me down

You got it tough, I&rsquo;ve seen the toughest around

And I know, baby, just how you feel

You got to roll with the punches and get to what&rsquo;s real

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

Ah, can&rsquo;t you see me standing here

I got my back against the record machine

I ain&rsquo;t the worst that you&rsquo;ve seen

Ah, can&rsquo;t you see what I mean?

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

Ah, might as well jump (jump)

Might as well jump

Go ahead and jump (jump)

Go ahead and jump

Ow, oh, hey, you

Who said that?

Baby, how you been?

You say you don&rsquo;t know

You won&rsquo;t know until you begin

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

So can&rsquo;t ya see me standing here

I got my back against the record machine

I ain&rsquo;t the worst that you&rsquo;ve seen

Ah, can&rsquo;t you see what I mean?

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

Ah, might as well jump (jump)

Go ahead and jump

Might as well jump (jump)

Go ahead and jump

Jump


</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

Might as well jump (jump)

Go ahead and jump

Get it in, jump (jump)

Go ahead and jump

Jump

Jump

Jump

Jump
