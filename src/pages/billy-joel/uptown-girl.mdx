Uptown girl

She has been living in her uptown world

I bet she never had a backstreet guy

I bet her mama never told her why

I'm gonna try for an uptown girl

She has been living in her white bread world

As long as anyone with hot blood can

And now she's looking for a downtown man

That's what I am

And when she knows what

She wants from her time

And when she wakes up

And makes up her mind

She'll see I'm not so tough

Just because I'm in love with an uptown girl

You know I've seen her in her uptown world

She's getting tired of her high class toys

And all her presents from her uptown boys

She has got a choice

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

Uptown girl

You know I can't afford to buy her pearls

But maybe someday when my ship comes in

She'll understand what kind of guy I've been

And then I'll win

And when she's walking

She's looking so fine

And when she's talking

She'll say that she's mine

She'll say I'm not so tough

Just because I'm in love with an uptown girl

She has been living in her white bread world

As long as anyone with hot blood can

And now she's looking for a downtown man

That's what I am

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

Uptown girl

She's my uptown girl

You know I'm in love with an uptown girl

My uptown girl

You know I'm in love with an uptown girl

My uptown girl
