<LyricSection>

She has got a smile that it seems to me

Reminds me of childhood memories

Where everything was as fresh as the bright blue sky

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

Now and then when I see her face

She takes me away to that special place

And if I stared too long

I&rsquo;d probably break down and cry

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

Woah, wo, oh

Sweet child o&rsquo; mine

Woah, wo, oh, oh

Sweet love of mine

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

She&rsquo;s got eyes of the bluest skies

As if they thought of rain

I&rsquo;d hate to look into those eyes

And see an ounce of pain

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

Her hair reminds me of a warm safe place

Where as a child I&rsquo;d hide

And pray for the thunder and the rain to quietly pass me by

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

Woah, wo, oh

Sweet child o&rsquo; mine

Woah, wo, oh, oh

Sweet love of mine...

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

Where do we go?

Where do we go now?

Where do we go? ...

Where do we go now? ...

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

Sweet child, sweet child o&rsquo; mine

</LyricSection>
