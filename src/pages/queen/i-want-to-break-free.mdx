<LyricSection>

I want to break free

I want to break free

I want to break free from your lies

You&rsquo;re so self-satisfied

I don&rsquo;t need you

I&rsquo;ve got to break free

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

God knows

God knows I want to break free

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

I&rsquo;ve fallen in love

I&rsquo;ve fallen in love for the first time

And this time I know it&rsquo;s for real

I&rsquo;ve fallen in love

Yeah!

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

God knows

God knows I&rsquo;ve fallen in love

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

It&rsquo;s strange but it&rsquo;s true

Hey yeah!

I can&rsquo;t get over the way you love me like you do

But I have to be sure

When I walk out that door

Oh! how I want to be free, baby

Oh! how I want to be free

Oh! how I want to break free!

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

But life still goes on

I can&rsquo;t get used to living without,

Living without, living without you

By my side

I don&rsquo;t want to live alone

Hey!

God knows, got to make it on my own

So baby, can&rsquo;t you see?

I&rsquo;ve got to break free!

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

I&rsquo;ve got to break free

I want to break free

Hey yeah!

I want, I want, I want, I want to break free!

</LyricSection>
