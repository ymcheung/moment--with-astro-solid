<LyricSection>

Is this the real life?

Is this just fantasy?

Caught in a landslide

No escape from reality

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

Open your eyes

Look up to the skys and see

I&rsquo;m just a poor boy, I need no sympathy

Because I&rsquo;m easy come, easy go

Little high, little low

Any way the wind blows doesn&rsquo;t really matter to me, to me

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

Mama, just killed a man

Put a gun against his head

Pulled my trigger, now he&rsquo;s dead

Mama, life had just begun

But now I&rsquo;ve gone and thrown it all away

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

Mama, woo woo woo...

Didn&rsquo;t mean to make you cry

If I&rsquo;m not back again this time tomorrow

Carry on, carry on, as if nothing really matters

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

Too late

My time has come

Sends shivers down my spine

Body&rsquo;s aching all the time

Goodbye everybody

I&rsquo;ve got to go

Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

Mama, wooo (any way the wind blows)

I don&rsquo;t want to die

I sometimes wish I&rsquo;d never been born at all

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

I see a little silhouetto of a man

Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango?

Thunderbolt and lightning very, very frightening me.

Galileo (Galileo)

Galileo (Galileo)

Galileo Figaro

Magnifico-o-o-o-o

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

I&rsquo;m just a poor boy, nobody loves me

He&rsquo;s just a poor boy from a poor family

Spare him his life from this monstrosity

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

Easy come, easy go, will you let me go

Bismillah! No, we will not let you go. (Let him go!)

Bismillah! We will not let you go. (Let him go!)

Bismillah! We will not let you go. (Let me go!)

Will not let you go. (Let me go!)

Never let you go (Never, never, never, never let me go)

Oh oh oh oh

No, no, no, no, no, no, no

Oh, mama mia, mama mia (Mama mia, let me go)

Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for me

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

So you think you can stone me and spell my eye?

So you think you can love me and leave me to die?

Oh baby, can&rsquo;t do this to me, baby

Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

Ooooh, oh yeah, oh yeah

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

Nothing really matters

Anyone can see

Nothing really matters

Nothing really matters to me

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

Any way the wind blows...

</LyricSection>
