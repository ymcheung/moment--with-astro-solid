<LyricSection>

All the old paintings on the tombs

They do the sand dance

Don&rsquo;t you know?

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

If they move too quick

They&rsquo;re falling down like a domino

All the bazaar men by the Nile

They got the money on a bet

Gold crocodiles they snap their teeth

On your cigarette

Foreign types with their hookah pipes say

Walk like an Egyptian

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

The blond waitresses take their trays

They spin around and they cross the floor

They&rsquo;ve got the moves

You drop your drink then they bring you more

All the school kids so sick of books

They like the punk and the metal band

When the buzzer rings

They&rsquo;re walking like an Egyptian

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

All the kids in the marketplace say

Walk like an Egyptian

Slide your feet up the street

Bend your back

Shift your arm then you pull it back

Life&rsquo;s hard you know

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

So strike a pose on a Cadillac

If you want to find all the cops

They&rsquo;re hanging out in the donut shop

They sing and dance

They spin the clubs cruise down the block

All the Japanese with their yen

The party boys call the Kremlin

And the Chinese know

They walk the line like Egyptian

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

All the cops in the donut shop say

Walk like an Egyptian

Walk like an Egyptian

</LyricSection>
