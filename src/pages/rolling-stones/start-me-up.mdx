<LyricSection>

If you start me up, if you start me up

I'll never stop

If you start me up, if you start me up

I'll never stop

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

I've been running hot

You got me ticking gonna blow my top

If you start me up

If you start me up I'll never stop

Never stop...

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

You make a grown man cry...

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

Spread out the oil, the gasoline

I walk smooth, ride in a mean, mean machine

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

Start it up

If you start it up

Kick on the starter give it all you got, you got to...

I can't compete with the riders in the other heats

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

If you rough it up

If you like it I can slide it up...

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

Don't make a grown man cry...

My eyes dilate

my lips go green

My hands are greasy

She's a mean, mean machine

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

Start it up

Start me up

Give it all you got

You got to never, never, never stop

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

Slide it up

Baby up just slide it up

Start it up, start it up, start it up

Never, never, never

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

You make a grown man cry...

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

Ride like the wind at double speed

I'll take you places that you've never, never seen

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

If you start it up

Love the day and we will never stop...

Tough me up

Never stop, never stop

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

You, you, you make a grown man cry

You, you make a dead man cum...

</LyricSection>
