<LyricSection>

I want my MTV...

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

Now look at them yo-yos

that&rsquo;s the way you do it

You play the guitar on the MTV

That ain&rsquo;t working

that&rsquo;s the way you do it

Money for nothing and your chicks for free

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

Now that ain&rsquo;t working

that&rsquo;s the way you do it

Let me tell ya them

guys ain&rsquo;t dumb

Maybe get a blister on your little finger

Maybe get a blister on your thumb

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

We got to install microwave ovens

Custom kitchen deliveries

We got to move these refrigerators

We got to move these colour TVs

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

See the little faggot with the earring and the makeup

Yeah buddy that&rsquo;s his own

That little faggot got his own jet airplane

That little faggot he is a millionaire

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

We got to install microwave ovens

Custom kitchens deliveries

We got to move these refrigerators

We got to move these colour TVs

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

Got to install microwave ovens

Custom kitchens deliveries

We&rsquo;ve got to move these refrigerators

Got to move these colour TVs

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

I should learned to play the guitar

I should learned to play them drums

Look at that mama she got it

Sticking in the camera man

We could have some fun

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

And he&rsquo;s up there

what&rsquo;s that? Hawaiian noises?

Banging on the bongoes like a chimpanzee

Oh, that ain&rsquo;t working

that&rsquo;s the way you do it

Get your money for nothing

get your chicks for free

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

We got to install microwave ovens

Custom kitchen deliveries

<LyricSection>

Listen here

Now that ain&rsquo;t working

That&rsquo;s the way you do it

You play the guitar on the MTV

That ain&rsquo;t working

That&rsquo;s the way you do it

Money for nothing and your chicks for free

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

Money for nothing and chicks for free

Get your money for nothing

And your chicks for free

Money for nothing

Chicks for free

Get your money for nothing

Chicks for free

Chicks for free

Get you money for nothing

Get your chicks for free

Get you money for nothing

Money for nothing

Chicks for free

Get you money for nothing

And the chicks for free

Get you money for nothing
