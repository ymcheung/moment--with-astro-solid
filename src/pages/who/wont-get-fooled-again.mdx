<LyricSection>

We&rsquo;ll be fighting in the streets

with our children at our feet

and the morals that they worship will be gone

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

And the men who spurred us on

Sit in judgment of all wrong

They decide and the shotgun sings the song

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

I&rsquo;ll tip my hat to the new Constitution

Take a bow for the new revolution

Smile and grin at the change all around

Pick up my guitar and play

Just like yesterday

Then I&rsquo;ll get on my knees and pray

We don&rsquo;t get fooled again

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

Change

it had to come

We knew it all along

We were liberated from the fold

that&rsquo;s all

And the world looks just the same

And history ain&rsquo;t changed

Because the banners

they all flown in the last war

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

I&rsquo;ll tip my hat to the new Constitution

Take a bow for the new revolution

Smile and grin at the change all around

Pick up my guitar and play

Just like yesterday

Then I&rsquo;ll get on my knees and pray

We don&rsquo;t get fooled again

No! no!

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

I&rsquo;ll move myself and my family aside

If we happen to be left half alive

I&rsquo;ll get all my papers and smile at the sky

For I know that the hypnotized never lie

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

Yeah!

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

There&rsquo;s nothing in the street

Looks any different to me

And the slogans are effaced

by the bye

And the parting on the left

Is now the parting on the right

And the beards have all grown longer overnight

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

I&rsquo;ll tip my hat to the new Constitution

Take a bow for the new revolution

Smile and grin at the change all around

Pick up my guitar and play

Just like yesterday

Then I&rsquo;ll get on my knees and pray

We don&rsquo;t get fooled again

Don&rsquo;t get fooled again

No! no!

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

Yeah!

Meet the new boss

Same as the old boss

</LyricSection>
