<LyricSection>

Won&rsquo;t you come see about me?

I&rsquo;ll be alone, dancing you know it baby

Tell me your troubles and doubts

Giving me everything inside and out and...

Love&rsquo;s strange so real in the dark

Think of the tender things that we were working on

Slow change may pull us apart

When the light gets into your heart, baby

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

Don&rsquo;t you, forget about me

Don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t

Don&rsquo;t you, forget about me

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

Will you stand above me?

Look my way, never love me

Rain keeps falling, rain keeps falling

Down, down, down

Will you recognize me?

Call my name or walk on by

Rain keeps falling, rain keeps falling

Down, down, down, down

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

Don&rsquo;t you try and pretend

It&rsquo;s my feeling we&rsquo;ll win in the end

I won&rsquo;t harm you or touch your defenses

Vanity and security

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

Don&rsquo;t you forget about me

I&rsquo;ll be alone, dancing you know it baby

Going to take you apart

I&rsquo;ll put us back together at heart, baby

Don&rsquo;t you, forget about me

Don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t

Don&rsquo;t you, forget about me

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

As you walk on by

Will you call my name?

As you walk on by

Will you call my name?

When you walk away

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

Or will you walk away?

Will you walk on by?

Come on, call my name

Will you call my name?

I say

Will you call my name?

As you walk on by

</LyricSection>
