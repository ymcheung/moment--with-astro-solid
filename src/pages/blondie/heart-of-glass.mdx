<LyricSection>

Once I had a love and it was a gas

Soon turned out had a heart of glass

Seemed like the real thing, only to find

Mucho mistrust, love is gone behind

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

Once I had a love and it was divine

Soon found out I was losing my mind

It seemed like the real thing, but I was so blind

Mucho mistrust, love is gone behind

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

In between, what I find is pleasing and I&rsquo;m feeling fine

Love is so confusing, there&rsquo;s no peace of mind

If I fear I&rsquo;m losing you

It&rsquo;s just no good

You teasing like you do

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

Once I had a love and it was a gas

Soon turned out had a heart of glass

Seemed like the real thing, only to find

Mucho mistrust, love is gone behind

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

Lost inside, adorable illusion and I cannot hide

I&rsquo;m the one you&rsquo;re using, please don&rsquo;t push me aside

We could have made it cruising yeah

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

Yeah, riding high on love is true bluish light

Oooh woo wah...

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

Once I had a love and it was a gas

Soon turned out, it was a pain in the ass

Seemed like the real thing only to find

Mucho mistrust, love is gone behind

</LyricSection>
