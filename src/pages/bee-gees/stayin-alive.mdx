<LyricSection>

Well, you can tell by the way I use my walk

I&rsquo;m a woman&rsquo;s man, no time to talk

Music loud and women warm

I&rsquo;ve been kicked around since I was born.

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

And now it&rsquo;s all right. It&rsquo;s OK

And you may look the other way

We can try to understand

The New York Times&rsquo; effect on man

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

Whether you are a brother

Or whether you are a mother

You are stayin&rsquo; alive, stayin&rsquo; alive

Feel the city breaking

And everybody shaking

And we&rsquo;re stayin&rsquo; alive, stayin&rsquo; alive

Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin&rsquo; alive, stayin&rsquo; alive

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin&rsquo;

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

Well, now, I get low and I get high

And if I can&rsquo;t get either, I really try

Got the wings of heaven on my shoes

I am a dancing man and I just can&rsquo;t lose

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

You know it&rsquo;s all right. It&rsquo;s OK

I&rsquo;ll live to see another day

We can try to understand

The New York Times&rsquo; effect on man

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

Whether you are a brother

Or whether you are a mother

You are stayin&rsquo; alive, stayin&rsquo; alive

Feel the city breaking

And everybody shaking,

And we&rsquo;re stayin&rsquo; alive, stayin&rsquo; alive

Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin&rsquo; alive, stayin&rsquo; alive

Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin&rsquo; alive

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

Life goin&rsquo; nowhere. Somebody help me

Somebody help me, yeah

Life goin&rsquo; nowhere. Somebody help me, yeah

Stayin&rsquo; alive

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

Well, you can tell by the way I use my walk,

I&rsquo;m a woman&rsquo;s man: no time to talk.

Music loud and women warm,

Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin&rsquo; alive, stayin&rsquo; alive

Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin&rsquo; alive

Life going nowhere. Somebody help me

Somebody help me, yeah

Life going nowhere. Somebody help me, yeah

I am stayin&rsquo; alive
