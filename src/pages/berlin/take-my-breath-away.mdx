<LyricSection>

Watching every motion in my foolish lover&rsquo;s game

On this endless ocean

Finally lovers know no shame

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

Turning and returning to some secret place inside

Watching in slow motion as you turn around and say

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

Take my breath away

Take my breath away

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

Watching I keep waiting

Still anticipating love

Never hesitating to become the fated ones

Turning and returning to some secret place to find

Watching in slow motion as you turn to me and say

My love

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

Take my breath away

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

Through the hourglass I saw you in time you slipped away

When the mirror crashed I called you

And turned to hear you say

If only for today

I am unafraid

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

Take my breath away

Take my breath away

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

Watching every motion in this foolish lover&rsquo;s game

Haunted by the notion

Somewhere there&rsquo;s a love in flames

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

Turning and returning to some secret place inside

Watching in slow as you turn my way and say

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

Take my breath away

My love...

</LyricSection>
