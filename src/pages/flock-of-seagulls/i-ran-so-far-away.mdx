<LyricSection>

I walk along the avenue

I never thought I would meet a girl like you

Meet a girl like you

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

With auburn hair and tawny eyes

The kind of eyes that hypnotize me through

You hypnotize me through

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

And I ran, I ran so far away

I just ran, I ran all night and day

I couldn&rsquo;t get away

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

A cloud appears above your head

A beam of light comes shining down on you

Shining down on you

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

The cloud is moving nearer still

Aurora Borealis comes in view

Aurora comes in view

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

And I ran, I ran so far away

I just ran, I ran all night and day

I couldn&rsquo;t get away

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

Reached out a hand to touch your face

You&rsquo;re slowly disappearing from my view

Appearing from my view

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

Reached out a hand to try again

I&rsquo;m floating in a beam of light with you

A beam of light with you

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

And I ran, I ran so far away

I just ran, I ran all night and day

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

And I ran, I ran so far away

I just ran, I couldn&rsquo;t get away...

</LyricSection>
