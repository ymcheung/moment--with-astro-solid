<LyricSection>

I hear the drums echoing tonight

But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation

She is coming in 12:30 flight

Her moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

I stopped an old man along the way

Hoping to find some old forgotten words or ancient melodies

He turned to me as if to say

&ldquo;Hurry, boy, it&rsquo;s waiting there for you&rdquo;

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

It&rsquo;s gonna take a lot to drag me away from you

There&rsquo;s nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do

I bless the rains down in Africa

Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

The wild dogs cry out in the night

As they grow restless longing for some solitary company

I know that I must do what&rsquo;s right

Sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

I seek to cure what&rsquo;s deep inside

Frightened of this thing that I have become

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

It&rsquo;s gonna take a lot to drag me away from you

There&rsquo;s nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do

I bless the rains down in Africa

Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

&ldquo;Hurry, boy, she is waiting there for you&rdquo;

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

It&rsquo;s gonna take a lot to drag me away from you

There&rsquo;s nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do

I bless the rains down in Africa

I bless the rains down in Africa

I bless the rains down in Africa...

Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

</LyricSection>
