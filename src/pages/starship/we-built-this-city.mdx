We built this city

We built this city on rock and roll

Built this city

We built this city on rock and roll

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

Say you don&rsquo;t know me

or recognize my face

Say you don&rsquo;t care who goes

to that kind of place

Knee deep in the hoopla

Sinking in your fight

Too many runaways eating up the night

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

Marconi plays the mambo

Listen to the radio

Don&rsquo;t you remember?

We built this city

We built this city on rock and roll

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

We built this city

We built this city on rock and roll

Built this city

We built this city on rock and roll

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

Someone is always playing corporation games

Who cares, they&rsquo;re always changing corporation names

We just want to dance here

Someone stole the stage

They call us irresponsible

Write us off the page

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

Marconi plays the mambo

Listen to the radio

Don&rsquo;t you remember?

We built this city

We built this city on rock and roll

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

We built this city

We built this city on rock and roll

Built this city

We built this city on rock and roll

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

It&rsquo;s just another Sunday

In a tired old street

Police have got the choke hold

oh...

Then we just lost the beat

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

Who counts the money

underneath the bar?

Who rides the wrecking ball

into our guitars?

Don&rsquo;t tell us you need us

&rsquo;Cause we are the ship of fools

Looking for America

Coming through your schools

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

I&rsquo;m looking out over that Golden Gate bridge on another gorgeous sunny Saturday and I&rsquo;m seeing that bumper to bumper traffic.

Don&rsquo;t you remember?...

Here&rsquo;s your favorite radio station, in your favorite radio city, the city by the bay, the city that rocks, the city that never sleeps.

Marconi plays the mambo

Listen to the radio

Don&rsquo;t you remember?

<LyricSection>

We built this city

We built this city on rock and roll

Built this city

We built this city on rock and roll

Built this city

oh...

We built this city on rock and roll

Built this city

We built this city on rock and roll

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

We built, we built this city

Built this city

We built

We built this city...
